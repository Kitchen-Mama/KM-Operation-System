# Deployment Release Log

> Append-only ledger of production/verification releases. Governed by `DEPLOYMENT_RELEASE_GOVERNANCE.md`.
> Do **not** enter fake production values. A commit that has not been pushed/deployed is recorded as **NOT DEPLOYED**.
> Git push and Apps Script deployment are separate explicit steps — record each when it actually happens.

```
Release ID:                  RG-2026-08-04-manual-release-control
Environment:                 (none — NOT DEPLOYED, NOT PUSHED)
Git branch:                  main
Git state:                   local ahead 41 / behind 0 vs last-known origin/main 0ea7838 (all local-only, unpushed)
Auto-push found:             NO (LOCAL_COMMIT_ONLY) — no hooks / no Actions / no clasp / no scripts / no VS Code task / no push alias
External candidates:         GitHub Desktop, VS Code "Sync" or user-level git.postCommitCommand, cloud folder sync (user-machine, not in repo)
Ownership frozen:            AUTOMATIC_REMOTE_WRITE=PROHIBITED · DEFAULT_BOUNDARY=LOCAL_COMMIT_ONLY · PUSH_OWNER=USER · APPS_SCRIPT_SYNC_OWNER=USER · DEPLOYMENT_OWNER=USER
Changed files:              CLAUDE.md (new — REMOTE WRITE PROHIBITION); DEPLOYMENT_RELEASE_GOVERNANCE.md §0; DEPLOYMENT_RELEASE_LOG.md   → all GIT_ONLY / DOCUMENTATION_ONLY
Apps Script files synced:    NONE
Deployment:                  NONE
Smoke-test result:           n/a — governance/instruction only; no business code changed
Notes:                       No remote command executed this round. User next action = review, then manually `git push origin main` if desired (see CLAUDE.md / §0).

Git commit:                  <this round's checkpoint commit>
Git commit subject:          fix(fc): persist special events and refine release-safe navigation ui
Changed files:
  - assets/css/layout.css                                  GIT_ONLY + FRONTEND_GITHUB_PAGES_REQUIRED
  - assets/css/pages/fc-overview.css                       GIT_ONLY + FRONTEND_GITHUB_PAGES_REQUIRED
  - assets/js/pages/fc-summary.js                          GIT_ONLY + FRONTEND_GITHUB_PAGES_REQUIRED
  - assets/js/api/operation-system-db-api.js               GIT_ONLY + FRONTEND_GITHUB_PAGES_REQUIRED
  - assets/specs/active/apps-script/14_fc_write_handlers.gs   APPS_SCRIPT_SYNC_REQUIRED
  - assets/specs/active/apps-script/01_router.gs              APPS_SCRIPT_SYNC_REQUIRED
  - assets/tests/fc-special-event-persist.test.js          GIT_ONLY (test)
  - docs/planning/DEPLOYMENT_RELEASE_GOVERNANCE.md         DOCUMENTATION_ONLY
  - docs/planning/DEPLOYMENT_RELEASE_LOG.md                DOCUMENTATION_ONLY
  - docs/planning/API_MIGRATION_MASTER_PLAN.md             DOCUMENTATION_ONLY
Apps Script files synced:    NONE (not deployed)
Bundle source changed:       no  (no assets/js/core/*.js changed → 90_generated_*.gs NOT rebuilt/synced)
Bundle hash:                 n/a
Apps Script project:         (not synced)
Apps Script deployment version: (none)
Frontend deployment:         (not deployed to GitHub Pages)
Database migration:          none
Migration ID:                n/a
Backup reference:            n/a
Deployed by:                 n/a
Deployment time:             n/a
Smoke-test scope:            n/a (local Node tests only; see Completion Report)
Smoke-test result:           NOT DEPLOYED
Known limitations:           Special-Event edit requires event_fc_id + campaign_id on the row (legacy rows
                             without them fail closed, honest error). Batch handler + router are
                             APPS_SCRIPT_SYNC_REQUIRED and untested against a live deployment.
Rollback version:            n/a
Rollback result:             n/a
Notes:                       Deployment deferred to explicit user-controlled release. When released:
                             (1) push commit + verify remote hash; (2) sync ONLY 14_fc_write_handlers.gs
                             and 01_router.gs into Apps Script (verify no other .gs overwritten);
                             (3) confirm bound Spreadsheet identity; (4) create a deployment version;
                             (5) redeploy GitHub Pages for the frontend (fc-summary.js / css / api);
                             (6) smoke-test on the verification copy first.
```

**STATUS: NOT DEPLOYED.**
