# CP2R — the reveal-callback render scope, measured in six interleaved pairs

`node assets/tests/_cp2r-warm-expand-runner.js <outDir> --skus 100`, driven alternately over two builds.
Acceptance: `assets/tests/ir-reveal-callback-scope-s8-b3-r3-cp2r.test.js` §E.

## What the two arms are

The arms differ by **exactly two identifiers** — whether each panel gate's `onReveal` is the raw paint or
the paint wrapped in `_irWithRenderPass_`. Nothing else in the file moves between them.

| arm | files |
|---|---|
| `unscoped-1..6.json` | `onReveal: _irRecoRevealPaint_` / `_irExecRevealPaint_` |
| `scoped-1..6.json` | `onReveal: _irRecoRevealOnce_` / `_irExecRevealOnce_` **(shipped)** |

`pairs.json` is the driver's own summary of the same twelve runs.

## Why pairs, and why they are never pooled

Unscoped and scoped alternate **inside each pair**, so the machine's drift lands on both arms of every pair
instead of on one batch. This is not a style preference: in CP2P, four pooled runs per side said a variant
was 22% faster and ten interleaved pairs showed it slower in 10 of 10. Batches are compared **within
themselves only**, never across.

## What was measured BEFORE anything was scoped

CP2P-R2 already scoped the synchronous handler. A 100-SKU expand still ran **seven** full-station
assemblies after the handler returned, ~170 ms. Seven calls is not by itself a reason to add a scope — a
render scope may only share inside **one synchronous turn**, so seven turns of one call each would be
uncapturable under the approval, and the honest answer would have been "nothing to do here".

So the runner stamps every call with its turn: a marker microtask is queued at the **first** call of a turn,
and anything still in that task reads the same number. The answer decided the round:

```
7 calls   ·   3 turns   ·   one turn assembling 5 times
```

Four of the seven are capturable **without any share outliving the callback that made it**.

## The result (six pairs, median of per-run medians)

| | unscoped | scoped | paired delta | improved in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| click → first paint | 60.2 ms | 55.0 ms | −3.6 ms | 4 of 6 |
| **click → full ready** | **218.7 ms** | **111.5 ms** | **−102.0 ms** | **6 of 6** |
| assembly **in** handler | 25.4 ms | 25.6 ms | +1.8 ms | 1 of 6 |
| **assembly after handler** | **172.8 ms** | **68.1 ms** | **−95.4 ms** | **6 of 6** |
| handler sync | 27.3 ms | 28.1 ms | +1.5 ms | 1 of 6 |

## What this does NOT claim

**First paint is not improved, and it cannot be.** First paint is the frame in which the expand panel first
has a layout box; every scoped callback runs after that frame. The −3.6 ms here is drift, and an earlier
batch of the same design produced +3.8 ms with 2 of 6 — it oscillates around zero, which is what "unchanged"
looks like. §E4 is therefore **one-sided**: it refuses a regression and deliberately does not require an
improvement.

**The synchronous handler is unchanged.** CP2P-R2 owns that scope; this round did not widen it. The +1.8 ms
and +1.5 ms rows are the same drift seen from the other side.

**Nothing crosses a callback, a frame or an event.** The scope releases in a `finally` the moment the
callback returns; outside a scope nothing is stored and nothing is consulted. The next frame, the other
panel and every later continuation each assemble for themselves — which is why the "after handler" row falls
by about half rather than to zero, and why it should.

**This is a 100-SKU fixture on one machine.** It is not a production measurement.

## An earlier batch was discarded

A first set of twelve runs of this same design was thrown away before it became evidence: the runner is
derived from `_cp2p-ir-expand-runner.js` and still pinned **that** file as its instrument, so the captures
named a runner that had not produced them. The hash was correct and the attribution was false. The runner
now pins itself and the batch was re-taken.
